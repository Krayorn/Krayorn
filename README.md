## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Krayorn, a software engineer at Golem.ai. Big fan of board games and role playing games, I like to write a bit.

## Some of my projects

I've got my own blog that you can find at [krayorn.com](https://krayorn.com).

I've started a board game logging app with the repository [here](https://github.com/Krayorn/bg_log). It's not open yet, and it's lacking a lot, but that's one of my long term side project!

I'm also creating a idle/clicker game, the first version is super short and testable at [https://krayorn.github.io/DwarfClicker/](https://krayorn.github.io/DwarfClicker/). Got some fun plans for this game.
