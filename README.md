## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Krayorn, a software engineer at Golem.ai. Big fan of board games and role playing games, I like to write a bit. I'm also interested in AI, old school symbolic or neural nets.

## Some of my projects

I've got my own blog that you can find at [krayorn.com](https://krayorn.com).

I've started a board game logging app with the repository [here](https://github.com/Krayorn/bg_log). It's not open yet, and it's lacking a lot, but that's one of my long term side project!

I'm also creating a idle/clicker game, the first version is super short and testable at [https://krayorn.github.io/DwarfClicker/](https://krayorn.github.io/DwarfClicker/). Got some fun plans for this game.

I've participated in some Algo Arena Challenges hosted by [vjeux](https://x.com/Vjeux), you can see the code for them in this [repository](https://github.com/Krayorn/AlgoArena-Submissions).

I'm learning a bit about neural nets by following the from zero to hero, intro to neural networks serie by [Andrej Karpathy](https://x.com/karpathy). You can see my attempts at some of the exercises in this [repository](https://github.com/Krayorn/neural-network-zero-to-hero-exercises), with a writeup available in [this post](https://www.krayorn.com/posts/zero-to-hero-neural-networks-bigram-trigram-language-models/).

Finally, here's a [simple website](https://scotland-public.krayorn.com/) about a trip I made to Scotland. I loved the trip and making a journal-like site about it! You can read a bit about the process in [this post](https://www.krayorn.com/posts/scotland-trip-diary/).
